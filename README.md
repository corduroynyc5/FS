# FS2013-Calendar
FS2013 calendar mod

- converts game days to day of the week, date and year (day 1 is January 1, 2013)
- adds seasonality
    
    ..weather and temperature changes (cold in winter/hot in summer)
    
    ..crop planting seasons (seeding is disabled for crops depending on the month)

Notes: For more realism, extend the growth times of crops in your map.i3d file.
       This is a functioning mod but still in progress so there are a lot of print statements that will show up in your log..sorry!


- TODOs:
    
    ..change day length according to season
    
    ..create a frost mechanism so the crops wither if exposed to harsh temps
    
    ..decrease yield if planted out of season (this would replace disabled seeding)
